    <title>Looking for a lovely new flatmate! :)</title>

      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <p>
        We’re Jules and Lara, an international couple (Spanish, Canadian,
        Belgian) who have been living in Brussels for 7 years. Our ad is in
        English, mais nous parlons couramment le français.
      </p>
      <p>
        🧭 We’re looking for a new flatmate or flatmates to live with us in our
        bright, 2-bedroom flat situated near to the Palais de Justice. The room
        is 2.75 x​​​ 3.45 metres (9.5m2) and is available from the 1st of
        August, but we’re willing to wait until September for the right match!
      </p>
      <p>
        🚵 After 3.5 years, our current flatmate is embarking on a long-term
        bicycle trip and doesn’t know when they’ll be coming back to Brussels,
        so we’re looking for the next person or people to make a new home
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        🙋‍♂️ Jules loves to make things – from the dining table to the spice
        shelf, tinkering for bicycle adventures, helping friends fix their bikes
        and furniture, converting what’s left in the fridge into a fantastic
        meal, and writing code. 🙋‍♀️ Lara loves music (listening at home while
        cooking and doing emails, as much as going out until the sun is rising),
        spending time with friends, watching anime, and is getting back into
        regular bouldering and yoga. 🫶 We love watching films at home with the
        projector (we might watch 3 a week in the winter!), hosting long
        brunches and dinners, chatting with friends for hours about everything
        happening in life and the world, and (re)discovering all that Brussels
        has to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        🐶🐈 We pet-sit regularly (usually dogs, sometimes cats), so our home is
        the perfect place if you enjoy the occasional cuddle and play with a
        furry friend. Jules works from home pretty much full time and Lara works
        from home 2-3 days a week, which allows us to take care of so many
        animal friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        😋 We’re vegetarians at home and so would prefer to live with
        someone/people who align with that lifestyle, but this is not at all a
        deal-breaker.
      </p>
      <p>🌈 We are an LGBTQIA+ household and 420+ friendly.</p>
      <p>
        ✨ Something important to note is that we don’t have a hired cleaner –
        we all share cleaning duties weekly, and keeping a tidy and clean space
        is important to us. This is to make sure that we can all use the spaces
        when we want to, and feel at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        📍 We’re located 15 minutes away from both Midi and Central train
        stations by foot, close to both Louise and Hôtel des Monnaies metro
        stations, and have a great variety of supermarkets and markets within
        walking distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        👋 We’re looking for someone who will want to make this space their home
        for at least 6 months (and ideally longer), share meals and
        conversations together spontaneously, will be down to bring a drink to
        watch the sunset, suggest activities, want to play games and watch films
        together, etc. If you’re into takeaway dinners and evenings behind a
        closed bedroom door, we probably aren’t the right match.
      </p>
      <p>
        🏡 The room is fully furnished (see photos below) – all you need is to
        bring your sheets, towels and the items that make the spaces in and
        outside of your bedroom feel like home. We also have a fully equipped
        kitchen and love to cook! Don’t hesitate to bring kitchen tools and
        gadgets to make all your favourite things.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rent, which includes home insurance, private insurance
        (responsabilité civile), internet, water, gas, and electricity bills is
        EUR 685 for one person and EUR 750 for a couple. Domiciliation is
        welcomed. Please note that we're a non-smoking household.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for reading this far! If you’re interested, please write to
        <a href="mailto:larajun1986@gmail.com">larajun1986@gmail.com</a> and
        tell us about yourself and when you’d be available to move in.
