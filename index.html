    <title>Looking for a lovely new flatmate! :)</title>

      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <p>
        We’re Jules and Lara, an international couple (Spanish, Canadian,
        Belgian) who have been living in Brussels for 8 years. Our ad is in
        English, mais nous parlons couramment le français.
      </p>
      <p>
        🧭 We’re looking for a new flatmate or flatmates to live with us in our
        bright, 2-bedroom flat situated near the Palais de Justice. The room is
        2.75 x​​​ 3.45 metres (9.5m2) and is available from the 1st of March,
        but we’re willing to wait until April for the right match!
      </p>
      <p>
        🫰🫰🫰 Over our years in this flat, we've had the pleasure of sharing this
        space with amazing flatmates who have become good friends. Some stayed
        for 6 months during an internship, some for a year, one moved out
        because they got married, one had to run home before the borders shut
        due to COVID, and one stayed for almost half the time we've lived here
        before biking off to Norway! The point is, this flat has been a real
        lovely place filled with great people, and we’re looking for the next
        person or people to join us in making this space feel like home
        together.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        🚵 After 3.5 years, our current flatmate is embarking on a long-term
        bicycle trip and doesn’t know when they’ll be coming back to Brussels,
        so we’re looking for the next person or people to make a new home
        together.
      </p> -->
      <p>
        🙋‍♂️ Jules loves to make things – from furniture like the dining table and
        the spice shelf, tinkering for bicycle adventures, helping friends fix
        their bikes and home projects, converting what’s left in the fridge into
        a fantastic meal, thinking and chatting about unexpected topics, and
        writing code. 🙋‍♀️ Lara loves music (listening at home while cooking and
        doing emails, as much as going out until the sun is rising), spending
        time with friends, watching anime, and is getting back into regular
        bouldering and yoga. 🫶 We love watching films at home with the projector
        (we might watch 3 on a particularly yucky week in winter!), hosting long
        brunches and dinners, chatting with friends for hours about everything
        happening in life and the world, and (re)discovering all that Brussels
        has to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        🐶🐈 We pet-sit regularly (usually dogs, sometimes cats), so our home is
        the perfect place if you enjoy the occasional cuddle and play with a
        furry friend. Jules works from home pretty much full time and Lara works
        from home 2-3 days a week, which allows us to take care of so many
        animal friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        😋 We’re vegetarians at home and so would prefer to live with
        someone/people who align with that lifestyle, but this is not at all a
        deal-breaker.
      </p>
      <p>🌈 We are an LGBTQIA+ household and 420+ friendly.</p>
      <p>
        ✨ Something important to note is that we don’t have a hired cleaner –
        we all share cleaning duties weekly, and keeping a tidy and clean space
        is important to us. This is to make sure that we can all use the spaces
        when we want to, and feel at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        📍 We’re located 15 minutes away from both Midi and Central train
        stations by foot, close to both Louise and Hôtel des Monnaies metro
        stations, and have a great variety of supermarkets, bulk food stores,
        bio shops, and markets within walking distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        👋 We’re looking for someone who will want to make this space their
        home, share meals and conversations together spontaneously, will be down
        to bring a drink (alcoholic or other) out to watch the sunset together,
        suggest activities to check out around town, want to play games and
        watch films, etc. If you’re into takeaway dinners and evenings behind
        your closed bedroom door, we probably aren’t the right match.
      </p>
      <p>
        🏡 The room is fully furnished (see photos below) – all you need is to
        bring your sheets, towels and the items that make the spaces in and
        outside of your bedroom feel like home. We also have a fully equipped
        kitchen and love to cook! Don’t hesitate to bring kitchen tools and
        gadgets to make all your favourite things.
      </p>
      <p>
        💱 The rent, which includes home insurance, private insurance
        (responsabilité civile), internet, water, gas, and electricity bills is
        EUR 685 for one person and EUR 750 for a couple. Domiciliation is
        welcomed. Please note that we're a non-smoking household.
      </p>
      <p>
        🗒 One detail to note is that our landlords have just (in January) put
        the apartment up for sale. They tried to sell it once 7 years ago and
        didn't find a buyer. Regardless, if there is a sale, Belgian law
        dictates that any existing leases continue with the new owner. In
        addition, we have a long-term lease, so according to Belgian law again,
        the earliest that a buyer would be able to ask us all to move out would
        be six months after ownership of the flat transfers to them. This would
        be, at the earliest, in September. Given this mild uncertainty, we're
        looking for a new flatmate for the initial 6 months, but will be very
        happy to extend that if all goes well.
      </p>

        Thanks for reading this far! If you’re interested, please write to
        <a href="mailto:larajun1986@gmail.com">larajun1986@gmail.com</a> and
        tell us about yourself and when you’d be available to move in.

          PS: Friends have told us that the photos make the apartment look
          smaller than it is, so do keep that in mind</span
